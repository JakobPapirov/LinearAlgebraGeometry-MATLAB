# LinearAlgebraGeometry-MATLAB

I am writing the code in Swedish with the intent of translating it to English later, this affects the comments and displayed text.

This program will ask questions about adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing matrices (finding the inverse).
Solving a matrix.
Finding the trace, rank and determinant of a matrix.
Dot and cross products.
Distance from a point to a plane.
Distance from a line to a plane.
Transpose matrix.

I will try to add bases, orthogonal projections, reduced row echelon form, and other functions.
